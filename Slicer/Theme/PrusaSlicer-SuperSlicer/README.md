# PrusaSlicer/SuperSlicer Theme

This lets you add your Vzbot330 heat bed to your Slicer, to have a customized look and feel to it.

This customization is realized in two steps. 

* A .stl that represents the heat bed and frame
* A .svg that displays the Vzbot Logo.



## Custome Bed assembly

There are two different versions available. You can choose the full bed assembly with all the bells and whistles or you choose the light weight option which os only the bed without the frame or attached parts. The full bed assembly does take a bit longer to load, when you open the slicer. 

This are your two options, choose one from the bed assembly folder:

* Custom_bed_assembly_vz330.stl 
* Vz330_bed.stl 




## Build plate(texture)

For the texture of the Build plate there are mulitple options. There is the Logo, the Logo but 40% Transparent and the outline only option. The Logo can block the view from under the bed to the slice part, to reduce that problem we made an option that lets you see through the Logo. Also if that is still blocking to much of the view, we made a version with only the outlines of the logo.

This are the three options to choose from the Texture folder

* VzBot_PS_bed_330.svg
* VzBot_PS_bed_330_outline.svg
* VzBot_PS_bed_330_transparent.svg

Here is a little comparison between the textures, so you can make the right choice:

On the Bed Shape window click on the Load button in the Texture section and choose the Texture you downloaded from here. Repeat the same for the Model section where you upload the bed assembly.

If you have selected both proberly the names of the files will appear in the window. If you see the names you can click on OK and confirm your choice. If you now switch back to the 3D view Tab. It will take a moment, because that is the moment where the texture and the bed assembly model will be loaded into the program. If everything works and looks how you wanted it, make sure to save your Printer settings.
